HOW TO RUN:
python -m hal_fuzz.harness -c Display.yml ./inputs/garbage

TIPS:
Create a running configuration in pycharm so it's easier to launch and debug

e.g
python3 -m hal_fuzz.harness -c Display.yml ./inputs/garbage -d -t -b 0x080005f4

INFO:
After replacing some hal we have unmapped writes error!
This is because the location of the file buffer for the LCD display is hardcoded as (0xc0000000) which is normally unmapped!
By creating a map inside the configuration of hal-fuzz we can solve this problem and emulation works!
