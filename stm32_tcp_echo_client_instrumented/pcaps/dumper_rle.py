# Dumps Ethernet frames from a folder of pcapng files for use with AFL
# takes any packet going to dst_mac, or sent as a broadcast.
# Frames are encoded with an RLE style format -- a little-endian length followed by
# the data, followed by 0xdeadbeef
# When we load the data later after AFL gets to it,
# if the frame doesn't end with 0xdeadbeef, afl mutated the wrong thing, tell it not to!
